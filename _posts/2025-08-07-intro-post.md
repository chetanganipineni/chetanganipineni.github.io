This blog is a collection of my notes, research, and thoughts on topics ranging from computer science and security engineering to math, history, and more.

I'll (try to) post:
- Summaries and highlights from books and papers
- Deep-dives on security, cryptography, and systems
- Math problems and solutions
- Personal reflections and learning journeys

Posts will be posted randomly.
